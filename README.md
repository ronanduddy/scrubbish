[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ronanduddy/scrubbish.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ronanduddy/scrubbish)

## Installation

Clone the repo and add the domain that one would wish to scrape in [scrubbish.env.example](scrubbish.env.example), afterwards the `example` postfix may be removed. 

## Usage (WIP)

Then run the following

```Shell
make run
```

A CSV file will be generated containing helpful information on properties in your area.

## Development

Run `make test` to run all the tests or `make test-dev` to run tests as python files are saved.
